The easiest way to use git. On any platform. Anywhere.

[![xkcd](xkcd.png)](https://xkcd.com/1597/)

Git is known for being a versatile distributed source control system that is a staple of many individuals, communities, and even for [the City of Chattanooga to crowd source bicycle parking locations](https://github.com/cityofchattanooga/Bicycle-Parking).  However, it is not known for userfriendlyness or easy learning curve.

Ungit brings user friendliness to git without sacrificing the versatility of git.

 * Clean and intuitive UI that makes it easy to _understand_ git.
 * Runs on any platform that node.js & git supports.
 * Web-based, meaning you can run it on your cloud/pure shell machine and use the ui from your browser (just browse to http://your-cloud-machine.com:8448).
 * Works well with GitHub.
 * [Gerrit](https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/) integration through plugin: https://github.com/FredrikNoren/ungit-gerrit

Installing
----------
Requires [node.js](http://nodejs.org) (≥ 4.1), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (≥ 2.14.3, comes with node.js) and [git](http://git-scm.com/) (≥ 1.8.x). To install ungit just type:

	npm install -g ungit

NOTE: If your system requires root access to install global npm packages, make sure you use the -H flag:

	sudo -H npm install -g ungit

Using
-----
Anywhere you want to start, just type:

	ungit

This will launch the server and open up a browser with the ui.

Configuring
---------
Put a configuration file called .ungitrc in your home directory (`/home/USERNAME` on \*nix, `C:/Users/USERNAME/` on windows). Configuration file must be in json format. See [source/config.js](source/config.js) for available options.

You can also override configuration variables at launch by specifying them as command line arguments; `ungit --port=8080`. To disable boolean features use --no: `ungit --no-autoFetch`.

Example of `~/.ungitrc` configuration file to change default port and enable bugtracking:

```json
{
  "port": 8080,
  "bugtracking": true,
  "gitCommand": "D:\\Apps\\Git\\bin\\git"
}
```

Normally you shouldn't configure much, but in case your `git` command is not on `$PATH`, you could set `gitCommand` parameter in `~/.ungitrc`

```json
{
  "gitCommand": "/path/to/your/git"
}
```

On Windows `gitCommand` should be set like the following (remember of escaping backslashes):

```json
{
  "gitCommand": "D:\\Apps\\Git\\bin\\git"
}
```

External Merge Tools
--------------------
If you have your own merge tool that you would like to use, such as Kaleidoscope or p4merge, you can configure ungit to use it. See [MERGETOOL.md](MERGETOOL.md).

Auto Refresh
------------
Ungit will watch git directory recursively upon page view and automatically refresh contents on git operations or changes on files that are not configured to be ignored in `.gitignore`.

One caveat is that node's [`fs.watch()`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/fs.html#fs_fs_watch_filename_options_listener) with `recursive: true` option is only available in Mac and Windows.  For non Mac and Windows machines, git operations will be automatically refreshed but file changes may require manual refreshes as `fs.watch()` is unable to detect changes within nested directory hierarchy.

Known issues
------------

* If you're running MacOSX Mavericks and Ungit crashes after a few seconds; try updating npm and node. See [#259](https://github.com/FredrikNoren/ungit/issues/259) and [#249](https://github.com/FredrikNoren/ungit/issues/249) for details.
* Ubuntu users may have trouble installing because the node executable is named differently on Ubuntu, see [#401](https://github.com/FredrikNoren/ungit/issues/401) for details.
* Debian Wheezy's supported git and nodejs packages are too old, therefore download newest [git](https://github.com/git/git/releases) and [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/download/) tarballs and [build from source](http://www.control-escape.com/linux/lx-swinstall-tar.html).
* Adblocker may block Ungit! Some ad blockers, such as [Adblock plus](https://adblockplus.org) and [uBlock](https://www.ublock.org/), don't like localhost api calls and assume that it is a cross domain attack.  Please whitelist `{localhost|127.0.0.1|$UngitURL}:{ungit port number}`. [#887](https://github.com/FredrikNoren/ungit/issues/887) [#892](https://github.com/FredrikNoren/ungit/issues/892)
